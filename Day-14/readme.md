# Vnet Peering in Azure

## Introduction
- VNet peering enables you to connect two virtual networks in the same region through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the virtual networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, much like traffic is routed between virtual machines in the same virtual network.

## VNet Peering
- VNet peering is a mechanism to connect two virtual networks in the same region through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the virtual networks appear as one, for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, much like traffic is routed between virtual machines in the same virtual network.

## VNet Peering Configuration
- VNet peering is configured by creating peering links between the virtual networks. The peering links are created between the virtual networks, not between the subnets. Once the peering links are created, the traffic between the virtual machines in the peered virtual networks is routed through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, much like traffic is routed between virtual machines in the same virtual network.
